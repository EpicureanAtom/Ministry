Subdiver u/ThomasOG73, reporting back from r/RiskyPorn

It’s pictures and videos of people engaging in sexual acts in public areas where there is a risk that they will get caught (as the name says). I didn’t spot anything that was even extreme, just regular run of the mill porn. 

I would rate it Level 2. Under 18’s stay out of there.

I have rated it as L2 due to the fact that, depending on the jurisdiction the posters are making their content, they could face criminal prosecution for indecent conduct or similar if they are caught. Therefore it’s bordering on breaking Rule 7 of the TOS. 

That’s just my opinion however.
