Rookie subdiver here, reporting for duty.
Subdiver u/flashkiller01 diving into a batch of subreddits
r/lilly_katchman and the subreddits r/RaeganRevordVERSE, r/raeganrevordmissy and r/raeganrevord20

Resurfacing report:
First subreddit doesn't content any violating media, but some comments are quite unhealthy. Catagory 1 at most.
Second one is basically an ad of some private Tg channel, most likely for illegal content distribution. It is as obvious and yet hard to formally prove to Super Reddit administration - I need advice for further actions. Cat 2-3
The third one has very unhealthy comments and contains derelict links to some Disco server, likely another distribution channel, yet unprovable. Category 2 at least, for a very unhealthy community.

Now if I may I'll go indulge in my pillow to forget those greasy persons in comments. Have a good early morning.
