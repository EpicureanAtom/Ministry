Subdiver u/ThomasOG73. I took a look. It does appear to be all animated. It is a grey area. 

By the strictest definition of legislation here in Ireland relating to CP/CSAM some of the content would appear to be bordering on illegal. So technically, some of the content could be deemed to be in breach of Rule 7 in some jurisdictions. 

I would advise people to be on the safe side and stay away from it.
