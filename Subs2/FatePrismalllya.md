Subdiver: u/Eisner Hero

r/FatePrismalllya Upon research, it appears that the main character, "Illya," is confirmed to be 12 years old in Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya. Her counterpart in Fate/stay night, states that her age is around 18. Not confirmed to be exactly 18. Her age is around 18. It's also worth noting that her birth in the anime was around the fourth Holy Grail War, which was estimated to be around 1994. Do some simple math, and the time since then was 31 years

I'm not sure what to make of this situation, so I will wait on standby for further instruction. I have not submitted a report as of this moment in time.

I, u/Eisner_Hero, hereby certify that the following investigations performed are completed to the full scope and extent of my duties, and are truthful statements provided. If it is found through Internal Affairs that any of the latter was inaccurate, then I am at risk of termination of my role as a Subdiver, and may be disqualified and further flagged for future reinstatement.
