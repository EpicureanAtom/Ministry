Subdiver Sergeant u/ThomasOG73 reporting back. 

I took a scroll. I would call for immediate nuclear annihilation of that subreddit. 

Some of the posts are “tribute” posts; i.e. pictures with a certain body fluid on them. 

I would recommend everyone stay as far away from that subreddit and report the life out of it.Sergeant u/switch_case_ taking a dive into r/aasaliraniiizahide. Be right back

Sergeant u/switch_case_ coming back from that sub.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED.
LEVEL 3

It's a german sub, and they're all about Zahide who is a minor. They openly admit that they like the underage part.

There are even people who say they are 15 themselves and get spammed with DM requests.

This is a CP hive.
