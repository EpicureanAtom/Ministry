Sergeant u/switch_case_ on the case. Into r/araara I go.

Sergeant u/switch_case_ back from his dive.

r/araara seems to be a sub dedicated to only usual kinky stuff.
It's just guys into MILFs as far as I could see.
It's also only fictional. Cartoon and anime drawn characters doing the things; step-sis, step-brother, step-mom, you know the deal.

I dont see anything breaking ToS as far as I was able to see.

Requesting Subdivers to further verify.
