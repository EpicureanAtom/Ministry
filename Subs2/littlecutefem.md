Subdiver u/ThomasOG73, diving into r/littlecutefem

Subdiver u/ThomasOG73, reporting back from r/littlecutefem. 

This subreddit contains pictures and videos of clearly underage girls. While there is no nudity or CSAM (that I could see); the comments related to the posts clearly are sexualising children. 

There are several photographs that are concentrated on the genital region of the child. Under Irish legislation that is considered CP/CSAM.

I would put it in a category 3, and advise members to stay away from it and report it. 

Eye bleach not required. I have seen far worse things
