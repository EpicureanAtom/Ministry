Alright, guys. Apprentice Subdiver u/switch_case_ taking a dive. See you in a bit.

u/switch_case_ returning from duty.

r/foodinbutt contains videos of women putting (a lot of peeled banana) food, mostly fruit like grapes, but also candy, into their rectum. But insertion seems to not be the important one. A lot of videos show only the ejection of some kind. 

I dont know if the kink has anything to do with the feeling of defecating, but I got very grossed out at some point and had to make my way back.

Requesting immediate delivery of eyebleach, thank you ministers.
