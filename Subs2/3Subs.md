Subdiver Sergeant u/ThomasOG73 reporting back. 

I took a scroll. I would call for immediate nuclear annihilation of that subreddit. 

Some of the posts are “tribute” posts; i.e. pictures with a certain body fluid on them. 

I would recommend everyone stay as far away from that subreddit and report the life out of it.
