Jeez, I did a deep dive of it, probably not the best choice for my second dive, and it's not good at all. I came here to see if that violated the TOS (as I assumed it did) and saw your post.

That said, my introduction to the internet was watching shit like the cartel videos, so it doesn't faze me that much, but I seem to have gotten a little more squeamish in my old age, lol
