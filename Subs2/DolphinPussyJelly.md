Subdiver u/JYANoob diving into r/DolphinPussyJelly, await my report.

u/JYANoob returning from r/DolphinPussyJelly. (God i hate having to type that)

Findings: No rules, really. Posts are tame though, the one NSFW post i found was just a text description. No mods really active, though itâ€™s a 4 year old sub with less than a few hundred members and 2 posts. Posts are labeled correctly, and nothing really TOS-breaking. 
This subreddit is category 1-2. 

u/JYANoob over and out.
