r/SmallAndCute - This one will be in-depth, since there are numerous characters to go over, though I won't waste time doing every single character.

Post Title: Yoshimi ready for spooktober

Yoshimi is confirmed to be 15 years old in Blue Archive, with her official birthday being August 29, 2007. The timeline of the Blue Archive game is around 2022. Do some math, and she barely passes the mark for being underage for sexually explicit content; her 18th birthday just passed this year. Furthermore, the post shows Yoshimi in mummified bandages, which appears to be an official skin for her in-game. Monitor for ageplay.

Post title: Clara wanted to show you her new swimsuit

Clara appears to sound around the age range of 13 to 15 in her home game of Honkai: Star Rail

The post shows Clara in a very micro-sized bikini, which raises some flags. Doing some research, she does not appear to have an official birthday. Postponed the post itself just to be on the safe side, will continue to monitor the subreddit.

Post title: Why is our hime pout?

The post shows an image of Tanaka Hime from Fate. Prisma Illya standing up and the camera showing an intimate area. After some research, Hime is a young adult woman, which based on this information, means her age is minimally 18. Young adulthood usually begins in college as well. Continue to monitor

Post title: This cute vampire awakens something on many people

The character portrayed is Oshino Shinobu. One of the comments links the source with a Pixiv link, which is known to harbor NSFW content. After some research on Shinobu herself, it states that her physical age is 8 years old, and her true age is 598 years, due to some lore about her becoming a pureblood vampire.

Post title: Beach time with Momoka

The character depicted is Yuragi Momoka from Blue Archive. In-game, she is a first-year student, who estimates her age to be around 15 to 16, while her birth year falls around 2008 to 2010. Reporting this on the basis that she is portrayed as a minor in a micro-bikini, and doing the math for years, she would have been 17 at best with her official birth month and day being September 3. Although she is not shown to have an arched back or legs spread out, or if any pose is neutral (such as holding a beach ball), combining a minor with a micro-bikini is considered or can be interpreted as sexualized framing.

Final Personal Verdict: Will require more divers to do their own research as well. Will await Ministry to activate a Call to Arms, as the subreddit itself contains a mixture of content that could fall under Category 3

I, u/Eisner_Hero, hereby certify that the following investigations performed are completed to the full scope and extent of my duties, and are truthful statements provided. If it is found through Internal Affairs that any of the latter was inaccurate, then I am at risk of termination of my role as a Subdiver, and may be disqualified and further flagged for future reinstatement.
