subdiver u/QueenSquidly14 reporting back, yeah it's fucked I'm not gonna lie... I have dealt with thoughts of sh and shing in general, trust me it gets better. 

Seeing the state of that sub it's very concerning that there are so many children there, nobody should ever self harm, that includes children, I'm going to start reporting the sub and the posts in it now
