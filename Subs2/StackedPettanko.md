Subdiver u/ThomasOG73 diving into r/stackedpettanko

Edit:

Subdiver u/ThomasOG73 reporting back from r/stackedpettanko

Everything I saw was drawings and animation. It all appears to be based on (or is from) Anime and Manga. Not being overly familiar with that art style, I find it difficult to say if it is depicting minors. 

For the time being, I would say Level 2. 

But if a more experienced Subdiver wants to take a look and give their opinion. Feel free to do so.

Edit 2:
Based on the response by u/Awkward-Egg-411, I will raise my assessment to Level 3. 

Report and do not enter.
