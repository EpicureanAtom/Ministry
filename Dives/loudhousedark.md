Category 3: owl house after dark

Many of the characters are teens (specifically 14). A major CP sub with a good bit of hardcore, but more softcore (still nude or scantily clad, just doesn't have sex actions). Credit to u/bignerd21 for investigating. I will give eyebleach to those who need it.

Category 2, Subdiver. 

Since it is drawn, Super Reddit TOS is hit or miss. A lot of this type of material *isn't* gotten rid of by the Super Reddit Moderation team. 

It is still a good find, Subdiver. Just miscategorized.

thanks, captain. i just saw that it was still kids and made it category 3 (along with bignerd’s report on my original OCTAS post, but i also told him about it after providing eye bleach). apologies tho. i don’t see why reddit usually doesnt just ban loli since it’s still children (and it could eventually lead to some of the posters seeing they go unpunished and have live action cp).
