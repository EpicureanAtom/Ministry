r/Iv4tori, two moderators, rules are barebones and not enforced.                                                   

Extra details: u/Clutch_Mythical (one of the moderators) is active in the subreddit with a lot of posts, he runs some groups on Session and Telegram. Couldn't determine what kind of content he has. The other moderator (u/kamrianri) is less active. There are also a lot of other users talking about "teens" and sharing Telegram/Session groups. The person who the subreddit is dedicated to is called Tori Deasy, despite only turning 18 on the 14th of August, the subreddit goes back several months. A lot of the first posts also request the "Esli monkey video." Which is a video of an Esli look-alike masturbating on the monkey app. Esli is 14 (13 at the time of that video).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

r/NaturalBopz, lots of moderators, some rules protecting minors.                                                  

Context: this was said about person who appears to be barely of age (if they weren't a minor already).                                                        

- She is incredible!!                                              
- Legendary over the years.                                
- So true! Love the early years.                          
- Me too!                                                                

I've seen it with Anfisa where they use barely legal teens to hid them sharing explicit videos of the person when they were younger.

Needs elaboration

r/Eslililil (subreddit for Esli, I see a lot of the same Telegram groups, one discord server was for "cheese pizza").
