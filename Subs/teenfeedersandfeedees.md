-- (Breaks rule 4, contains kink related content geared towards minors)

-- Sub contains two threads asking members under 18 to look for feeders and feedees. This, although the members might not realize it, is a sexual kink. It also promotes and/or glorifies a problematic eating disorder such as binge eating.

-- Minor involvement in erotic content: Because the subreddit explicitly involves teens (minors) in a sexual or fetish context, it violates Reddit’s content policy regarding sexual content involving minors.

-- Potential for grooming / exploitation: Publicly declaring ages (15–18) in a sexual context opens the possibility of adults interacting or exploiting minors, or encouraging unsafe behavior.
