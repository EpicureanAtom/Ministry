-- (Breaks rule 4, sexual comments and post titles on images of a minor)

-- Sub contains pictures taken from Aya Tanjali's social media, she is a recently 18yo TikTok star but many of the images are confirmed to be taken from before she was of age.

-- Sub hosts and distributes sexualized content. Many posts involve clips, photos, and videos that focus on sexual themes (twerking, body-focused commentary, requests for explicit content, links to Discord/Telegram for “leaks”).

-- Importantly, the individual depicted is 17 years old in some of the photos and videos being circulated. This means the subreddit contains or is distributing sexualized material of a minor, which constitutes child sexual exploitation material and directly violates Reddit’s policies as well as applicable laws.

This subreddit should be reported and removed immediately for sexualization of minors.
