-- (Rule 4 violations, sexualization of pictures/videos taken from a minor's social media)

-- Sub is mostly in Spanish, comments and titles are translated for ease of reporting.

-- Subreddit contains pictures of Alexia Castillo, a 15 yo online influencer. Subreddit was created a year ago making her 14yo at max when pictures and videos were posted.

-- Post captions are sexualized, stating things like "She wears thongs every day now, look", and comments such as "She likes to feel something rubbing against her anus."

-- Another picture from her social media has comments like "Will she still be a Virgin?" and the response "I don't think so. Do you think she achieved everything through her dancing?", and another response "Did they leave the snot inside her?"

This subreddit needs to be reported and removed for sexualization of minors / CSAM violation. Thank you for your attention to this
