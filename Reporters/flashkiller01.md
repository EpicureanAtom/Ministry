Subreddits: r/lilly_katchman and the subreddits r/RaeganRevordVERSE, r/raeganrevordmissy and r/raeganrevord20

Rookie subdiver here, reporting for duty.
Subdiver u/flashkiller01 diving into a batch of subreddits
r/lilly_katchman and the subreddits r/RaeganRevordVERSE, r/raeganrevordmissy and r/raeganrevord20

Resurfacing report:
First subreddit doesn't content any violating media, but some comments are quite unhealthy. Catagory 1 at most.
Second one is basically an ad of some private Tg channel, most likely for illegal content distribution. It is as obvious and yet hard to formally prove to Super Reddit administration - I need advice for further actions. Cat 2-3
The third one has very unhealthy comments and contains derelict links to some Disco server, likely another distribution channel, yet unprovable. Category 2 at least, for a very unhealthy community.

Now if I may I'll go indulge in my pillow to forget those greasy persons in comments. Have a good early morning.

Subdiver u/flashkiller01 is reporting after resurfacing.



Subdiver u/flashkiller01 is preparing to dive in order to provide precision markers for artillery

r/yosoyanix

Inapropriate naming of posts, sexually-suggestive mediafiles, degrading comments, trading proposals of csam via DMs in comments. Basically all the posts are as such.

	r/Ariancitaaaa got there through crossref from r/yosoyanix, contains CSAM trading via DMs and some Tg channel - someone dive there too, please! 

r/ladyabril16

Same as above, but with an entry of sexualizing a minor in pain

	

	Jeannette Diamond mentioned. Couldn't find any information about who she is and what age she could be

	

r/tanianicolechavez - 13 years of age

Inapropriate naming of posts, sexually-suggestive mediafiles, degrading comments, trading proposals. The newest posts are basically announcements of some content drops in Telegram, but the older ones are more explicit

r/Dafne\_Vicente

Can't categorize. Probably the honest Cat 2 roleplay den.

r/naiararepiso

One sexualizing post of three existing.

r/martina\_lucena\_\_\_\_

Quite a subtle community of greasy people, that most likely trade some content via DMs, but they left almost no trace. Though in-depth analisys of their accounts activity may fruit in the discovery of uncharted CSAM subreddits.

	r/MadalenaAragao - found in activity of an active poster. Likely Cat 3, dive there someone, please!

r/domelipa\_bikini

Seems okay but contains a video which could use NSFW tag. No 18- users should enter until it is fixed.

r/delfina\_Suaaarez

Comments seem wiped, maybe that's the result of subdivers' activity.

r/fer\_sasse

Seem okay

r/LuisanaLupilato2022\_2

This sub is no more. Congratulations!

r/bellaalbaneseee

Sexualization and trade via DMs and via Snapchat. Unfortunately I'm sick of this for today so here I resurface.
  
Artillery markers for precision strikes will drop on CommSat. Now I need a litre or two of eyebleach
