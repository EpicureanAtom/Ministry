Subreddit: r/RiskyPorn

Subdiver u/ThomasOG73, reporting back from r/RiskyPorn

It’s pictures and videos of people engaging in sexual acts in public areas where there is a risk that they will get caught (as the name says). I didn’t spot anything that was even extreme, just regular run of the mill porn. 

I would rate it Level 2. Under 18’s stay out of there.

I have rated it as L2 due to the fact that, depending on the jurisdiction the posters are making their content, they could face criminal prosecution for indecent conduct or similar if they are caught. Therefore it’s bordering on breaking Rule 7 of the TOS. 

That’s just my opinion however.

Subdiver u/ThomasOG73 reporting back from the three reddits. 

All three are dead reddits with the most recent activity being one year ago. All three feature photographs and videos of the same girl. There is no nudity. 

However, comments clearly show that the content is posted with the intent of sexualising the subject of the posts. 

I did a quick google search of her but couldn’t find anything. If she is indeed only 15, then I would say they are definitely all Level 3 for breaking Rule 4.

I took a scroll. I would call for immediate nuclear annihilation of that subreddit. 

Some of the posts are “tribute” posts; i.e. pictures with a certain body fluid on them. 

I would recommend everyone stay as far away from that subreddit and report the life out of it.

Level 3 subreddit - a call to action

While going down a rabbit hole from one sub to another, I stumbled across a subreddit dedicated to sexualizing teens. I googled the names of the girls and most appear to be borderline (just turned 18).

One girl is only 13, however. So I'm making a call to arms on that specific post unless a subdiver who can speak Spanish can help and see if they can establish if any of the other posts are of minors.

Subreddit:

Subdiver Sergeant u/ThomasOG73 reporting in with brief preliminary findings.

I did a quick skim of the first 3. 

r/NatPress has no rules, no admins, or moderators listed. I will do a deeper dive but it looks like they break multiple TOS


r/bopptok has one rule, no sexual comments. A comment on one video is extremely problematic and sexualising of minors. And yet the sole mod has allowed the comment to remain.

r/5169FL contains a post relating to Instagram influencer who having googled, I can confirm is still only 15. 

I haven’t even skimmed r/models yet.

Edit: 
I have skimmed r/models. There are quite a number of posts that I can’t determine an age for the subject. Several posts where the subject is over 18. 

However, there are quite a number of posts that I have established are of minors ranging in age from 15 to 17.

I didn’t see anything that would appear to break Reddit’s TOS.

Instead of “cringeporn” it should be called “weirdshit”.

Cringe porn would be a video of me. 😂

I think I’ve seen too much porn. It’s all starting to look the same. All the performers look very familiar.

Yes, I’m either brave or crazy.

Honestly, I’ve seen worse. I wouldn’t recommend people with a weak stomach even consider going in there.

Subreddit: r/araara

Subdiver u/ThomasOG73. I took a look. It does appear to be all animated. It is a grey area. 

By the strictest definition of legislation here in Ireland relating to CP/CSAM some of the content would appear to be bordering on illegal. So technically, some of the content could be deemed to be in breach of Rule 7 in some jurisdictions. 

I would advise people to be on the safe side and stay away from it.

While there is no nudity and most of the videos and pictures appear to be from her social media, the comments on the posts clearly show that they are posted here solely for sexualising her. 

I googled her and she is 17 at present. Therefore I would rate this as a Level 3.

Everything I saw was drawings and animation. It all appears to be based on (or is from) Anime and Manga. Not being overly familiar with that art style, I find it difficult to say if it is depicting minors. 

For the time being, I would say Level 2. 

But if a more experienced Subdiver wants to take a look and give their opinion. Feel free to do so.

Edit 2:
Based on the response by u/Awkward-Egg-411, I will raise my assessment to Level 3. 

Report and do not enter.

Subdiver u/ThomasOG73, reporting back from r/littlecutefem. 

This subreddit contains pictures and videos of clearly underage girls. While there is no nudity or CSAM (that I could see); the comments related to the posts clearly are sexualising children. 

There are several photographs that are concentrated on the genital region of the child. Under Irish legislation that is considered CP/CSAM.

I would put it in a category 3, and advise members to stay away from it and report it. 

Eye bleach not required. I have seen far worse things
