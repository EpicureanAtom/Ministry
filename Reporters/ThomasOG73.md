Subreddit: r/RiskyPorn

Subdiver u/ThomasOG73, reporting back from r/RiskyPorn

It’s pictures and videos of people engaging in sexual acts in public areas where there is a risk that they will get caught (as the name says). I didn’t spot anything that was even extreme, just regular run of the mill porn. 

I would rate it Level 2. Under 18’s stay out of there.

I have rated it as L2 due to the fact that, depending on the jurisdiction the posters are making their content, they could face criminal prosecution for indecent conduct or similar if they are caught. Therefore it’s bordering on breaking Rule 7 of the TOS. 

That’s just my opinion however.



Subreddits: r/AlexityForever, r/AlexityWorld, r/La_Putita_De_Alexity

Subdiver u/ThomasOG73 reporting back from the three reddits. 

All three are dead reddits with the most recent activity being one year ago. All three feature photographs and videos of the same girl. There is no nudity. 

However, comments clearly show that the content is posted with the intent of sexualising the subject of the posts. 

I did a quick google search of her but couldn’t find anything. If she is indeed only 15, then I would say they are definitely all Level 3 for breaking Rule 4.



Subreddit: r/aasaliraniiizahide

Subdiver Sergeant u/ThomasOG73 reporting back. 

I took a scroll. I would call for immediate nuclear annihilation of that subreddit. 

Some of the posts are “tribute” posts; i.e. pictures with a certain body fluid on them. 

I would recommend everyone stay as far away from that subreddit and report the life out of it.
