Subdiver u/GubyNey locking in for duty

Subdiver u/GubyNey returning to base from r/ariancitaaaa

FINDINGS:

Dominant Spanish posts, only a few handful of photos. Can’t understand what they’re saying but I smell they’re going sexual on her especially on the comments. Also, seen a few nude AI filters of her and reported that content.

Category 3. Need eyebleach

Subdiver u/GubyNey returning back from r/silvanarebolloo_ .

FINDINGS:

While there’s no nudity (atleast), there are bikini pics. Most comments are in Spanish so I don’t understand what they’re saying. But based on english comments and titles, it looks like they’re sexualizing her. I’ve seen one comment there asking about her 17 year old tits.

I’ll consider this as Category 3.

Got myself some eyebleach and I’ve seen far worse than what I’ve dived in: https://youtu.be/exkX_69gcpA?si=JwbNtEhi2aqFmsoh

Subdiver u/GubyNey, checking in

Subdiver u/GubyNey back from the dispatch!

FINDINGS:

Clearly sexualizing her. Even AI. Says the comments and text-only posts. I did report one of them but “doesn’t violate reddit rules” so the fight never stops. No nudity nor bikini pics thankfully, still this is concerning.

I’ll give it a category 3 because it involves a minor, which is considered predatory.

[Got some eyebleach as well](https://youtube.com/shorts/PDjf7B0mr64?si=x1Z1K8SQDb4qV-Dj) and I need more kitten pics
