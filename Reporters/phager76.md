Jeez, I did a deep dive of it, probably not the best choice for my second dive, and it's not good at all. I came here to see if that violated the TOS (as I assumed it did) and saw your post.

That said, my introduction to the internet was watching shit like the cartel videos, so it doesn't faze me that much, but I seem to have gotten a little more squeamish in my old age, lol

Meh, not that bad. Two posts of girls on those slingshot rides. No nudity or nipslips, but still a lot of the chesticles visible, lol.

Under 18 should avoid, but nothing rule breaking or traumatizing. I guess that puts it at a category 1? First time subdiving, so i may have the classification wrong.

Category 0. Nothing TOS breaking. 

No action required. 

Naturally, if it's 18+, list it as such.
