Subreddit: r/RiskyPorn

Subdiver u/SluttyMcSlutthefirst, diving into r/RiskyPorn

Subdiver u/SluttyMcSlutthefirst, reporting back from r/RiskyPorn. This subreddit contains mostly NSFW content about the topic exhibition,  risky nudity, and public sex. Category 1, not for users under 18.

Edit: Category 2 makes more sense.

Subreddit: r/usedandabusedteens

Subdiver u/SluttyMcSlutthefirst, reporting back from r/usedandabusedteens. I can't find proof that the women in the vids and pictures are underage. One of the most active members in this sub is a twenty years old women who are promoting her OF and her pictures there. Another one has links to her/his porn profiles. The user clips the stuff they spread in the sub from those porn sides, some are clear porn productions, others amateurs. Still, there are some vids and pics I can't definitely order because we are dealing here with hardcore porn. Also, some of those subreddits are reposting each other. Honestly, need help here because it's too much content. And need good old r/Eyebleach 

And keep this in mind, my fellow subdivers: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ministryofredditing/comments/1n0tjau/kink\_subreddits\_and\_you/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/ministryofredditing/comments/1n0tjau/kink_subreddits_and_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Subreddit: r/FilipnosAgainstChina

The subreddit doesn't seem to be activity racist against Chinese people. They even forbid such things in they rules.

Edit: Seems more about the "unlawful" influence of the CCP in that area. Used quoting marks because I don't know much about the politics in that area. But I won't categorise it as racist.
