Lots of moderators, some rules protecting minors.                                                  

Context: this was said about person who appears to be barely of age (if they weren't a minor already).                                                        

- She is incredible!!                                              
- Legendary over the years.                                
- So true! Love the early years.                          
- Me too!                                                                

I've seen it with Anfisa where they use barely legal teens to hid them sharing explicit videos of the person when they were younger.
