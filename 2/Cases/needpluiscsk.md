Account status: still up                                          

Investigation notes: the initial post (by a now deleted user) doesn't provide any context, only providing two messages (in DMs) from the individual. In the first message he introduces himself as a 35 year old from Mumbai; the second message is sexual in nature. They don't display any abnormal pervesions despite being creepy. Since we don't know the age of the poster I can't determine if they're predatory.                                                                 

Background check: they have a clear record. It appears the account is primarily focused on NSFW content but besides that, there is nothing of note.                                                       

Final verdict: innocent.
