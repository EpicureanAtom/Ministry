Account statue: shadow banned                         

Investigation notes: : the initial post (by a now deleted user) implies that the person involved has been harassing them for an extended duration, however, only a single message (in DMs) was provided. The message reads: "And you bitch, how are you? Are you feeling like getting fucked?" Since there seems to be recurring, unwanted sexual comments I would classify this as harrasment.

Final verdict: guilty
